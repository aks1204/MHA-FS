# Arrhythmia Feature Selection using Meta-Heuristic Algorithms

# Problem

Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeat or an abnormal heart rhythm. The heart normally beats in a regular pattern, but in individuals with arrhythmia, the heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Some arrhythmias may not cause any noticeable symptoms and may be harmless, while others can be more severe and potentially life-threatening.
There are several parameters/features that we might consider while classifying Arrhythmia into different types.
However, considering all parameters/features for Arrhythmia classification is computationally expensive while dealing with large datasets.
We have tried to optimize the problem of Arrhythmia classification by deciding upon which all features to select using Meta-Heuristic Algorithms.
We have used Random Forest Classfier to report for the accuracy of selected features in the Arrhythmia Classification Task.
